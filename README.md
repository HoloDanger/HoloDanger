# John Lester Lopez

I build calm, reliable, and humane systems in an age of digital fragmentation.

---

-   🌱 **Current Focus:** I'm currently undertaking a self-directed apprenticeship in the principles of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and Systems Thinking.
-   🛠️ **Core Toolkit:** Linux, Docker, Python, and the philosophies of Stoicism and Deming.
-   🔭 **Genesis Node:** Architecting a prototype "Sanctuary" mental wellness app, designed to be a tool, not a trap.
-   📜 **The Forge:** My public log, where I'm documenting this entire journey, can be found in the `/docs` directory of my `genesis-node-prototype` repository.
